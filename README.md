# Family tree

This is a command-line app to track a family tree. It's an exercise in using Active Record without Rails, and playing around with associations that aren't always straightforward.

A user is able to input a group of people and select who each person's parents are. Using that information, this app recognizes and displays other familial relationships, such as siblings, grandparents, children, grandchildren, great-grandparents to an arbitrary number of generations, great-granchildren to an arbitrary number of generations, nieces, nephews, and cousins.

As a learning project, this application demonstrates:
* Using Active Record to create a command-line CRUD application
* Adding information to a database from a command-line application
* Simple algorithmic design
* Recursion
* Looping
* Branching
